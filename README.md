## Introduction
Hi there! Iâ€™m Aqsa â€” an AI consultant, teacher, and future founder from Pakistan. I turn messy data into simple AI agents that save time and unlock new revenue. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m guiding students and junior devs on their first steps into machine learning.

## What I can do for your team
| Your pain | A fast first step |
| --- | --- |
| Too many manual tasks | A laserâ€‘focused AI agent in < 2â€¯weeks |
| Need AI skills inside the team | A handsâ€‘on bootcamp, plain English, live code |
| Big idea, no plan | A lean roadmap you can ship on Monday |

### Why this matters
- Teams using these agents report **50â€¯%** less manual ops.
- Trainees land AI roles within months of the workshop.
- Every prototype is scoped to real business goalsâ€”nothing fluffy.

## Building right now
- New agents that watch data streams and act on them.
- A free **AIâ€¯Jumpstart** course for resourceâ€‘limited students.
- First steps toward my own AIâ€‘first startup.
